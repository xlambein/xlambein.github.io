      <h1>My keyboard</h1>
    </header>
    <p>In my early twenties I started suffering from really bad RSI in my upper
    body, particularly in my wrists. Eventually it became a perfectly
    manageable part of my life, thanks to two big changes. First, and most
    importantly, I began exercising more regularly. Second, I became serious
    about the ergonomics of my work station. In particular, switching to an
    ergonomic keyboard helped a lot.</p>
    <p>This is a little write-up about my current mechanical keyboard. I
    explain why I switched to it, what I like about it, how I’ve set up its
    layout, and some ideas I have for future improvements.</p>
    <h1 id="the-quest-for-a-keyboard">The quest for a keyboard</h1>
    <p>Until a few years ago, the main ergonomic keyboard I used was the
    Microsoft Sculpt, which looks like this:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="microsoft-sculpt.png.jpg" alt="" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="600" height="370">
    </figure>
    <p>It’s a great keyboard and I recommend it. However, in late 2020, I
    decided I wanted to upgrade to one of these mechanical keyboards people
    have been talking about. Mostly, I wanted to have a truly split keyboard
    (as opposed to the “split-but-joint” Sculpt above), because I didn’t like
    my posture when using a more traditional one.</p>
    <p>To paint a picture, I wanted to spread both halves of the keyboard so
    they’re essentially as far apart as my hands are when resting, leaving
    space in the middle for a mouse or whatever else. In my case I put a mouse
    and a trackball there, or sometimes a drawing tablet<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. It’s very
    comfortable and convenient.</p>
    <p>The big names of the time were UHK and Ergodox, but I found them both
    expensive and unconvincing. Eventually, having learnt more about the
    subject, decided I wanted a minimalist keyboard (to minimize finger
    movements, better for RSI) with column stagger<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. And I
    wanted to solder it myself, because it’s fun to do!</p>
    <p>Eventually I found the <a href="https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-kits/products/kyria-rev3">Kyria</a>,
    sold by <a href="https://splitkb.com">splitkb.com</a>, a (then relatively
    new) Dutch company making keyboards PCBs and selling kits and accessories.
    The Kyria had a <a href="https://blog.splitkb.com/introducing-the-kyria/">convincing pitch</a> that
    spoke to me, and you could even print a test sheet to see if the layout was
    comfortable for your fingers. My decision was made quickly, and I ordered
    the parts.</p>
    <p>I got a bunch of the components from splitkb.com itself (mainly the PCB,
    screens, microcontrollers, and case), while the rest I ordered from a
    different place where it was cheaper. Overall, I think I just made my life
    more complicated, and I’d recommend buying everything directly from
    splitkb.com.</p>
    <p>I bought a soldering kit and assembled the thing pretty quickly, with
    some help from my partner who’d never soldered before, and who found it
    pretty easy and fun. I found pastel blue and pink keycaps in a local
    second-hand shop, but you can buy those online easily.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>Overall I’m very happy with my Kyria, and I’d recommend it to anyone
    with similar needs as me. That being said, as I’ll explain at the end, I’m
    considering getting a new keyboard in the future, based on my experience
    with this one.</p>
    <h1 id="keyboard-layout">Keyboard layout</h1>
    <p>The keyboard is fairly minimalist: it has a total of 50 keys, but at
    this point I use only about 37 of them. I have the 30 keys of the main
    Dvorak layout (<code>A-Z</code> and <code>',.;</code>) and then tab, space,
    enter, escape, backspace, “CCCV”, and a “super” key. I’ll get to these two
    later.</p>
    <p>As is typical with small keyboards like this one, the way you access
    other keys is with layers. A layer is basically a toggleable switch to a
    different set of keys for your keyboard. I have three main layers: my
    default, Dvorak layer, then a “symbols” layer with ASCII symbols, and a
    “numbers/fn/movement” layer with, you guessed it, numbers, Fn keys, and
    movement keys.</p>
    <p>I can temporarily access these layers by holding specific keys on the
    default layer. For example, if I hold the Space key on the left, I switch
    to the symbols layer, while if I press the Enter key on the right, I switch
    to the numbers layer. This works because layer keys are like modifier keys,
    and are only useful when held, not tapped. So tapping the Space key sends a
    space character, but holding it changes the layer.</p>
    <p>I also have two more layers that I use less often: a “French accented
    letters” layer (when I hold both layer keys at the same time) and a
    “gaming” layer with WASD and other things on the left side (which I toggle
    by tapping a key I don’t use otherwise).</p>
    <p>There’s still something missing though: what about the control, alt,
    shift and super keys? Well, remember how a key can be two things, depending
    on whether it’s tapped or held? Same thing again here: these four keys are
    on my home row (<code>AOEU HTNS</code> on Dvorak, <code>ASDF HJKL</code> on
    Qwerty), and activate when held. So if I want to do, say,
    <code>Ctrl+Z</code>, I hold the <code>U</code> key (or the <code>H</code>
    key), then tap the <code>Z</code> key.</p>
    <p>This <em>seems</em> weird and confusing, but it’s actually great and
    pretty quick to learn. The trade-off is that you cannot type <em>too</em>
    fast, otherwise you risk triggering a shortcut. In my experience, this was
    a problem at first, until I tweaked the timing. These days I never have
    that issue anymore.</p>
    <p>Earlier I mentioned a “CCCV” key. This is a key that, when held for a
    few milliseconds, sends <code>Ctrl+C</code>, and when tapped, sends
    <code>Ctrl+V</code>. It’s very convenient when using the mouse, since on
    Dvorak the <code>C</code> and <code>V</code> keys are on the right side,
    which is also the hand that holds my mouse. I put the CCCV key on the left
    side, so I can quickly select something with the mouse, copy it, and paste
    it somewhere else.</p>
    <p>Finally, I have an extra “super” tap key (in addition to the hold action
    for the <code>A</code> and <code>S</code> keys), which I use to trigger
    <code>wlr-which-key</code> in Sway.</p>
    <p>All of this is managed by microcontrollers on the keyboard, one per
    side. They are programmed by writing C code with a library called <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a>. It takes care of both the low-level stuff, as
    well as the fancier features I mentioned above like the hold-tap keys. In
    my experience it’s not too hard to use, especially as you can steal bits of
    C code from other people’s configs. The main downside is that any time you
    want to change something, you need to recompile the source code and flash
    it onto the controllers, which is a small but noticeable feedback
    delay.</p>
    <h1 id="future-improvements">Future improvements</h1>
    <p>Overall I’m quite happy with my setup. I do have a few annoyances that
    might lead me to buying a new keyboard in the future.</p>
    <p>First, I miss the numbers row. Right now, my top row becomes a numbers
    row in a different layer. It works well enough, but I never fully got used
    to it, and so I type numbers slower than I would on, say, my laptop’s
    keyboard. So I’m considering getting a new keyboard with less keys
    elsewhere, but with these 10 additional keys at the top. The model I’m
    eyeing is the <a href="https://splitkb.com/collections/keyboard-kits/products/elora">Elora</a>,
    which is essentially a Kyria with a numbers row.</p>
    <p>Second, I have a relatively thick keyboard, with high keys. It’s roughly
    2.5cm high, which is not too bad, but I think I’d prefer a thinner model,
    with low-profile keys.</p>
    <p>Third, the microcontrollers I have are not particularly fast, and with
    the overhead of the firmware, there’s a noticeable latency when typing.
    Eventually I got used to it, but it’s clearly not ideal. I’d like to either
    get faster microcontrollers, or somehow manage to increase the polling rate
    in the firmware.</p>
    <p>Finally, I still use my laptop keyboard regularly (otherwise, why have a
    laptop?), and so I often switch between those two ways of operating my
    keyboard. I’m considering stripping down my fancy QMK config, and instead
    setting up a custom layout as software (e.g., with <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad">kmonad</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd">keyd</a>). This might help with polling
    rate too, and it has the advantage of not needing to compile and flash the
    firmware every time I want to try a small layout change.</p>

          <p>This is when the keys are aligned in columns, but not in rows.
          This is done to match the length of your fingers, such that each one
          rests naturally on a home row key. Once I learnt about those,
          traditional keyboards started to seem just plain wrong.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p>
