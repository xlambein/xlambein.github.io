    <p>Last week-end I participated in the <a href="https://ldjam.com/">43rd Ludum Dare game jam</a>.  Participants in the Ludum Dare “Compo” (one of the two competitions, which I took part in) have to make a game based on a given theme in 48 hours without using external assets or code besides libraries.</p>
<h2><a href="#my-game" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="my-game"></a>My Game</h2>
<p>The theme for this year was “Sacrifices must be made”.  I quickly came up with three relatively bad ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>You are General Douglas Haig during the infamous battle of the Somme.  Your job is to send as many young Englishmen get murdered on the frontline as possible.</li>
<li>A Mayan sacrifice simulator, where you need to pry open someone’s chest and recover their heart.</li>
<li>A platformer in which you need to give up one game feature at each level.</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to go for the third one because the other two were too gruesome, and I wasn’t sure what to do with them anyway.</p>
<p>The final result is a game which I called “Sacrifice This Game”.  You can find it <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/sacrifice-this-game">on the ldjam website</a>.  It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="ludum-dare-43-001.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The game is a basic platformer.  You play with the directional arrows.  <code>Enter</code> selects an item in the menus.  <code>Tab</code> shows the pause menu.  The goal is to reach one of the doors.  Keys open locked blocks.  That’s it.</p>
<p>Well, except that, when you enter a new level, you are faced with this screen:</p>
<p><img src="ludum-dare-43-002.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Before continuing, you <em>have</em> to sacrifice one feature of the game.  It can be anything, from animations, to moving left, to gravity.  Once a feature is sacrificed, it stays that way for the following levels.  If you are stuck, you need to go back and change the choices you made earlier.</p>
<h2><a href="#technical-aspects" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="technical-aspects"></a>Technical Aspects</h2>
<p>The game was made with Python and the <a href="https://github.com/kitao/pyxel">Pyxel retro game engine</a>.  In retrospect, I would’ve preferred to make the game in JavaScript, because Python is a pain to distribute.  However, using Pyxel was a great experience, and it allowed me to fast-prototype the game.  With another engine, I’m not sure I would’ve had time to finish it—especially in JS, which I don’t know too well.</p>
<p>I am actually quite proud of the result!  I think it’s the best game I made so far, though I would’ve enjoyed to spend more time polishing the level design and fixing the terrible hand-made collision system.  And cleaning the <em>awful</em> code.  I’m thinking of porting it to JavaScript, in which case I would probably spend some time improving those aspects.</p>
<p>The source is available <a href="https://github.com/xlambein/ldjam43">on the Github repository</a>.  I would <em>not</em> recommend looking at it, though.</p>
