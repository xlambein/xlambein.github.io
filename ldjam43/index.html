    <p>Last week-end I participated in the <a href="https://ldjam.com/">43rd
    Ludum Dare game jam</a>. Participants in the Ludum Dare “Compo” (one of the
    two competitions, which I took part in) have to make a game based on a
    given theme in 48 hours without using external assets or code besides
    libraries.</p>
    <h1 id="my-game">My Game</h1>
    <p>The theme for this year was “Sacrifices must be made”. I quickly came up
    with three relatively bad ideas:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>You are General Douglas Haig during the infamous battle of the Somme.
      Your job is to send as many young Englishmen get murdered on the
      frontline as possible.</li>
      <li>A Mayan sacrifice simulator, where you need to pry open someone’s
      chest and recover their heart.</li>
      <li>A platformer in which you need to give up one game feature at each
      level.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I decided to go for the third one because the other two were too
    gruesome, and I wasn’t sure what to do with them anyway.</p>
    <p>The final result is a game which I called “Sacrifice This Game”. You can
    find it <a href=
    "https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/43/sacrifice-this-game">on the ldjam
    website</a>. It looks like this:</p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>The game is a basic platformer. You play with the directional arrows.
    <code>Enter</code> selects an item in the menus. <code>Tab</code> shows the
    pause menu. The goal is to reach one of the doors. Keys open locked blocks.
    That’s it.</p>
    <p>Well, except that, when you enter a new level, you are faced with this
    screen:</p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <p>Before continuing, you <em>have</em> to sacrifice one feature of the
    game. It can be anything, from animations, to moving left, to gravity. Once
    a feature is sacrificed, it stays that way for the following levels. If you
    are stuck, you need to go back and change the choices you made earlier.</p>
    <h1 id="technical-aspects">Technical Aspects</h1>
    <p>The game was made with Python and the <a href=
    "https://github.com/kitao/pyxel">Pyxel retro game engine</a>. In
    retrospect, I would’ve preferred to make the game in JavaScript, because
    Python is a pain to distribute. However, using Pyxel was a great
    experience, and it allowed me to fast-prototype the game. With another
    engine, I’m not sure I would’ve had time to finish it—especially in JS,
    which I don’t know too well.</p>
    <p>I am actually quite proud of the result! I think it’s the best game I
    made so far, though I would’ve enjoyed to spend more time polishing the
    level design and fixing the terrible hand-made collision system. And
    cleaning the <em>awful</em> code. I’m thinking of porting it to JavaScript,
    in which case I would probably spend some time improving those aspects.</p>
    <p>The source is available <a href="https://github.com/xlambein/ldjam43">on
    the Github repository</a>. I would <em>not</em> recommend looking at it,
    though.</p>
