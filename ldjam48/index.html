    <p>In April 2021, I participated in the 48th <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare game jam</a>.  The theme for this edition was “Deeper and deeper”, so natually, I made a game about machine learning.  You can <a href="https://xlambein.itch.io/truck-or-pupper">play it from the convenience of your browser, on itch.io</a>.</p>

<p>The idea is that you play as the sole, overworked data scientist in a start-up, and you need to balance the tasks of annotating new data and training the (deep, hence the theme) neural network that powers your company’s product.</p>
<p>The gameplay itself is an unapologetic Tetris rip-off, somehow combined with those Google captcha thingies we all hate to fill.  It’s pure <em>fun</em>.</p>
<p>This was my first time using Godot, so I wanted to do something relatively straightforward.  Even then, I struggled to finish the game on time, and it could certainly use some more balancing.</p>
<p>I did not score particularly great at the competition, although I did finish 41st in humor, and honestly that’s a totaly win for me.</p>
