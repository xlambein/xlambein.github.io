    <p>In April 2021, I participated in the 48th <a href=
    "https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare game jam</a>. The theme for this edition
    was “Deeper and deeper”, so natually, I made a game about machine learning.
    You can <a href="https://xlambein.itch.io/truck-or-pupper">play it from the
    convenience of your browser, on itch.io</a>.</p>

    <p>The idea is that you play as the sole, overworked data scientist in a
    start-up, and you need to balance the tasks of annotating new data and
    training the (deep, hence the theme) neural network that powers your
    company’s product.</p>
    <p>The gameplay itself is an unapologetic Tetris rip-off, somehow combined
    with those Google captcha thingies we all hate to fill. It’s pure
    <em>fun</em>.</p>
    <p>This was my first time using Godot, so I wanted to do something
    relatively straightforward. Even then, I struggled to finish the game on
    time, and it could certainly use some more balancing.</p>
    <p>I did not score particularly great at the competition, although I did
    finish 41st in humor, and honestly that’s a total win for me.</p>
