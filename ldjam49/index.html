    <p>Once again, I spent my weekend making a game for the bi-annual <a href=
    "https://ldjam.com">Ludum Dare game jam</a>. The theme for this jam was
    ‚ÄúUnstable‚Äù, so of course I went for horse puns. In the game, you play as a
    horse alchemist (a ‚ÄúChevalchemist‚Äù) working for the great Neighcolas
    Flamel. Your task is to mix together ingredients into increasingly complex
    recipes.</p>

    <p>It‚Äôs essentially a physics sandbox, in which the fun stems from how
    awful the controls are. It‚Äôs silly and stupid, and I‚Äôm extremely happy with
    how it turned out üòä</p>
    <p>The game can be played over on <a href=
    "https://xlambein.itch.io/chevalchemy-a-hoof-of-concept">itch.io</a>. Being
    a jam game, it cruelly lacks polish, but it‚Äôs totally playable. I recommend
    reading the (short) instructions below the game before starting. Or don‚Äôt,
    I won‚Äôt tell you how to live your life.</p>
    <p>Source code can be found on <a href=
    "https://github.com/xlambein/ldjam49">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <h1 id="making-of">Making Of</h1>
    <p>As always with these ‚Äú-athon‚Äù sorts of projects, it was an intense and
    stressful, but ultimately rewarding experience. Thanks to my new <a href=
    "https://github.com/xlambein/temps">time tracker</a>, I know that I spent
    just under 23 hours working on the game over the weekend, which is, uhh, a
    lot. Also, shout out to <a href="https://mandooks.com">Mandooks</a> who
    helped me brainstorm this idea, and who came up with great stuff that I
    didn‚Äôt have time to implement.</p>
    <p>Continuing what seems to be a tradition now, I used different tools from
    <a href="/ldjam48">last time</a>, choosing the <a href=
    "https://bevyengine.org">Bevy</a> Rust game engine with <a href=
    "https://rapier.rs">Rapier</a> for the physics. The experience was overall
    pleasant, although you can definitely feel the rough edges in these two
    projects. In particular, I kept running into bugs and obscure things with
    Rapier, which greatly slowed me down. Faced with broken collisions on
    Sunday morning, I almost gave up, until I managed to figure out a hack.</p>
    <p>In the past I‚Äôve almost always made games with ‚Äúcode-oriented‚Äù
    frameworks, and my experience with <a href=
    "https://godotengine.org">Godot</a> in April was a big realization of how
    great visual tools can be for game-making (yeah no shit). While it‚Äôs in the
    plans, Bevy currently lacks any tooling of the sort, so I ended up baking
    very primitive tools to help me place entities in a level and trace the
    collision contour of items. It works, but they‚Äôre far from the direct
    feedback and convenience of proper game editors.</p>
    <h1 id="porting-to-the-web">Porting to the Web</h1>
    <p>I developed the game without thinking about WASM support at all, but
    when I was done, I found myself regretting that the game could not be
    played in the browser. Bevy has a great <a href=
    "https://bevy-cheatbook.github.io">cheat book</a> with a section on how to
    compile to WASM, using a drop-in replacement for the rendering pipeline.
    Everything worked mostly as expected, but for some reason I could not
    control the size of the <code>canvas</code> element.</p>
    <p>After some internet digging, I found a game that managed to fix this
    issue, <a href="https://github.com/horup/some-tank-game-rs">‚ÄúSome Tank
    Game‚Äù by S√∏ren Alsbjerg H√∏rup</a>. Essentially, they have a custom ECS
    system that checks the window size and adapts it if it‚Äôs wrong. Their
    system is a bit more complex than what I ended up going for, as it also
    handles adapting the canvas size when the user resizes the window. Big
    thanks to them, without this I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to port the game to
    WASM ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
    <h1 id="future-plans">Future Plans</h1>
    <p>This turned out to be one of my favourite Ludum Dare projects, and I‚Äôm
    considering expanding it a little, to make it into a proper game. Some
    ideas I have for improvements are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The obvious stuff: a main menu, instructions, transitions between the
      levels, an end screen, polished graphics, etc.</li>
      <li>More items, especially with interesting properties like the rack with
      the test tubes.</li>
      <li>More and better levels.</li>
      <li>Music and sound effects.</li>
      <li>More static/dynamic objects in the background. For example, I was
      thinking of adding a lamp hanging from the ceiling, which items can hit
      and bounce off. Just to annoy the player even more.</li>
      <li>Maybe different environments, with different layouts and specific
      items.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Feedback and ideas are welcome! Don‚Äôt hesitate to <a href="/about">get
