# Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Xavier, I'm an artist and programmer from Brussels ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª.  I [make music](/music/) and do all sorts of coding projects &amp; experiments, some of which you'll find here.

I have many interests, including games&nbsp;ðŸ‘¾, music&nbsp;ðŸŽ¼, programming languages&nbsp;&#955;, and human-computer interaction&nbsp;ðŸ–±.  If you'd like to chat about any of these subjects, or about something else, don't hesitate to [reach out](/about).

I might also be available for freelance/part time jobs, so if you'd like to work with me, do get in touch.
