<h1>ðŸ¥š Something Most Wretched</h1>

<p>
  graceful egg<br>
  beautiful egg<br>
  painted white and blue<br>
  bejeweled by dew

<p>
  I<br>
  caress your shell and cry,<br>
  knowing one day you'll die<br>
  when that something most wretched<br>
  from your entrails hatched

<p>
  graceful egg<br>
  beautiful egg<br>
  I now must face the truth<br>
  for soon cometh the<br>
  goose
