<h1>ðŸ¥µ Hot</h1>

<p>
  he<br>
  is<br>
  hot.

<p>
  not sexy hot, but burning hot<br>
  his body like a flesh oven<br>
  wishing (praying) for cold<br>
  but he will not cool down<br>
  he's a broken thermostat

<p>
  his moist apartment, moldy and littered<br>
  with bottles, now emptyâ€”for<br>
  he left long ago<br>
  first for the basement, and<br>
  then for snow

<p>
  he could still eat but food<br>
  would burn on his tongue and<br>
  carbonize down his throat<br>
  his stomach was dry and<br>
  in lieu of digestion he would<br>
  breathe the ash in and<br>
  cough it out, a black cloud

<p>
  he will not dieâ€”of course he won't.<br>
  the fire burns too hot and<br>
  his heart, that steam engine,<br>
  will. not. stop.<br>
  pumping lava down his arteries<br>
  with each beat, pulsing and scorching<br>
  up his arms<br>
  down his legs and<br>
  all the way to the tip of his head

<p>
  when snow no longer sufficed<br>
  when it sublimed against<br>
  his naked body in<br>
  the dead of winter,<br>
  he headed north<br>
  for colder weather<br>
  then for colder water

<p>
  finally,<br>
  teathered to a rockâ€”<br>
  its smooth surface melting<br>
  to magma against his skinâ€”<br>
  he threw himself off land<br>
  and into the arctic depths

<p>
  there he remains, a hotspot volcano,<br>
  fizzing water into vapour<br>
  killing fish and changing the weather

<p>
  there's no longer ice in the north pole<br>
  and soon no more water either<br>
  the air is misty like Venus'<br>
  and everything is dying

<p>
  and at last<br>
  at very last

<p>
  he<br>
  is<br>
  tepid.
