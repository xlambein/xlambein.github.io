<h1>ðŸ¥€ moss</h1>

<p>
  sitting on my couch,<br>
  we were half drunk on sweet beer.<br>
  I spoke in this calloused voice<br>
  ploughing through words,<br>
  tryna find the ones that<br>
  will make love grow

<p>
  but I had it backwards:<br>
  love did not need growing.<br>
  the ground was fertile and<br>
  the seeds abundant<br>
  love sproutedâ€”moss on a grass lawn

<p>
  your words are like winter now.<br>
  it's August but the phone is freezing<br>
  and my voice, trembling

<p>
  once you told me you wished<br>
  some moments could be frozen in time<br>
  and lived through<br>
  forever

<p>
  I know what you meant now<br>
  but I also know<br>
  we don't have<br>
  the same<br>
  moments<br>
  in mind
