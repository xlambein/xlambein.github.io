<h1>ðŸ˜± By Night</h1>

<p>
  Soggy lips and toothy grin;<br>
  awake to blood and punctured skin.<br>
  You can't restrain the beast within<br>
  with soggy lips and toothy grin.

<p>
  A hairy chase in cool, white night.<br>
  Careful that it shan't die of fright,<br>
  for once they pass they don't taste right<br>
  after a hairy chase by night.

<p>
  Who dares disturb your peaceful rest<br>
  with crossed books and blessed quest?<br>
  By thousand devils you'll possess,<br>
  then may return to peaceful rest.
