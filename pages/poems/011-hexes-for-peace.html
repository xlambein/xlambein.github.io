<h1>ðŸ˜ˆ Hexes for Peace</h1>

<p>
  Catch the Devil in a bottle<br>
  made of rocks and watch him toddle.<br>
  With the gems and incantation,<br>
  lord of flies here I shall summon!

<p>
  Let him fuel our every magick<br>
  with satanic mathematicks.<br>
  Golems made of sand, awaken!<br>
  Light our hearths, night be forsaken!<br>

  <br>

<p>
  And doubtless he'll want to escape:<br>
  he'll try to melt his prison gate.<br>
  Cool him down and watch him bubble<br>
  in his bath of pest and trouble.<br>

<p>
  Catch the Devil in a bottle,<br>
  let him warm up and then throttle.<br>
  Make sure you don't burn him fast or<br>
  no-one knows how long you'll last for.<br>

  <br>

<p>
  If carelessly we set him free,<br>
  he'll burn our skin to third degree.<br>
  Dare to look him in the eyes and<br>
  you will beg for your demise.<br>

<p>
  He'll poison water in our wells<br>
  and plague the air with ashy spells,<br>
  becurse you to a life of sorrow<br>
  (if you're not dead by tomorrow).<br>

  <br>

<p>
  Catch the Devil in a bottle,<br>
  triple check your magick model.<br>
  If we ever set him free then<br>
  cursed me and cursed thee.
