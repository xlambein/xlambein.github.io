# Applesauce Pancakes

## Ingredients

- 1 cup (~150g) self-raising flour
- 1 dash all-spice
- (1 dash baking powder)
- 3 pinches kala namak
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1/2 cup (~150g) applesauce or (~120g) baked pumpkin
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1 tbsp oil

## Directions

1. Mix the dry ingredients together in a large bowl. Make a trough at the center and pour in the liquid ingredients, then progressively incorporate them into the dry ones. If too thick, add more milk or water.

2. Warm up a pan on medium heat. Check the temperature by pouring a teaspoon of dough onto the pan: it shouldn't cook too quickly, browining within a minute or so.
 
3. When the temperature is right, prepare the pancakes by pouring some dough, and letting it cook until bubbly. Flip, cook for the same amount of time on the other side, then take off the pan. Repeat until all the dough is exhausted.
