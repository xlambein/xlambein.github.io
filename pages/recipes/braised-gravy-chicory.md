# Pan-Braised Chicory

## Ingredients

- 4--5 medium chicory, halved
- 2 shallots, minced
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp veggie stock powder

## Directions

1. In a skillet with a lid, melt some butter and cook the shallots on medium heat, until they start to become translucent.

2. Sprinkle the brown sugar onto the shallots, then add add the chicory halves and sizzle them for a few minutes on both sides, letting them brown a little.

3. Mix the veggie stock powder with about half a cup boiling water, and pour over the chicory. Cover and let simmer for 10--15 minutes, adding more water if needed.

4. The chicory is cooked when fork-tender. If need be, remove the lid and let the sauce reduce to the consistency you desire.
