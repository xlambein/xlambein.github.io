# Broccoli Satay

## Ingredients

- 180g noodles (e.g., udon)
- 1 head broccoli (~500g), cut into florets
- 2 clove garlic, minced
- 3cm ginger, grated
- 80g peanut butter
- 60g red miso paste
- 1/4 cup soy sauce
- 1/2 lime, juiced
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, or more to taste
- sesame seeds, to serve
- sesame oil, to serve

## Directions

1. Heat up some oil in a wok. Cook the broccoli for a few minutes, stirring regularly, until they start browning.

2. Add the garlic, ginger, and about 5mm of hot water, then cover and let the broccoli steam until they're cooked through, adding more water if necessary.

3. In the meantime, cook the noodles according to the package instructions, reserving some pasta water at the end.

4. In a bowl, combine the peanut butter, red miso paste, soy sauce, lime juice, and red pepper flakes into a thick sauce.

5. Add the cooked noodles and the sauce to the wok, and mix thoroughly, adding some pasta water to dilute the sauce to the desired consistency.

6. When serving, top with sesame seeds and a dash of sesame oil.
