# Brussels Waffles

## Ingredients

- 250g self-raising flour
- 25g corn starch
- 40g brown sugar
- 1 bag vanilla sugar
- 375 milk
- 100g butter, melted
- 90ml aquafaba
- 1/2 tsp cream of tartar
- 1/4 tsp kala namak

## Directions

1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, corn starch, 10g brown sugar, and the vanilla sugar.

2. Incorporate the milk and butter into the bowl and mix until smooth.

3. Whisk the aquafaba with the cream of tartar, 30g brown sugar, and the kala namak, until it produces stiff peaks. Fold into the dough, taking care not to mix too much to avoid breaking the bubbles.

4. Heat up a waffle iron and cook each waffle for 3--5 minutes.

## Notes

Waffles freeze well, and can be reheated with a toaster. In my experience, they're often crispier after being toasted.
