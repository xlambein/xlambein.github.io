# Brussels Waffles

## Ingredients

- 250g semi-whole wheat flour T55
- 25g corn starch
- 40g brown sugar
- 1 bag vanilla sugar
- 1/4 tsp kala namak
- 375 milk
- 100g butter, melted
- 90ml aquafaba
- 1/2 tsp cream of tartar

## Directions

1. Combine the dry ingredients together in a large bowl.

2. Incorporate the milk and butter into the bowl and mix until smooth.

3. Beat the aquafaba with the cream of tartar until stiff, then combine with the dough, not mixing too much to avoid breaking the bubbles.

4. Heat up a waffle iron and cook each waffle for about 5 minutes.

## Notes

Waffles freeze well, and can be reheated with a toaster.
