# Crepes

## Ingredients

- 250g semi-whole wheat flour T80
- a pinch of salt
- 500ml milk

## Directions

1. Mix dry ingredients in a salad bowl.

2. Incorporate the milk progressively, stirring well until smooth.

3. If possible, leave the dough to rest for a few minutes, up to a few hours.

4. Heat up a pan on medium-high, and grease up when warm.

5. Pour in a small ladleful of dough, spread it and cook a few minutes.  When the crepe is easy to remove, flip it over and cook on the other side.

6. Continue until all the dough has been used, adding more oil when necessary.
