# Granola

## Ingredients

- 2 cups rolled oats
- 1/2 cup buckwheat
- 1/2 cup walnuts, crushed or chunked
- 1/2 cup cashew nuts, crushed or chunked
- 1/2 cup coconut flakes
- 2 tbsp chia seeds
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup maple syrup
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt, more to taste
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Directions

1. Pre-heat the oven to 125Câ€¯in convection mode.

2. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl and mix well. Give it a taste and adjust the salt and sugar.

3. On a baking tray lined with parchment paper, pour the mixture and lay it flat with a spatula.

4. Bake it in the oven for 25 minutes. Take it out, shuffle the granola around, and then bake it for another 25 minutes.

5. Take the tray out of the oven and let the granola cool down thoroughly before storing it in a sealed container in the fridge.

## Notes

- The ingredients are a mere suggestion. You should customize this to your liking. I recommend keeping roughly these proportions of various "kinds" of ingredients.
- Granola burns _very_ easily. If it's your first time with a given oven, keep an eye on it and give it a taste every ~10 minutes. If it's getting bitter, stop baking at once, and use a lower temperature next time.
- Using granulated sugar with a syrup works a lot better than just sugar.
