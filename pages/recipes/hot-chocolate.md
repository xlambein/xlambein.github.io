# Hot Chocolate

## Ingredients

- 1 cup oat milk (Oatly barista works well)
- 11--12g (~3 tsp) cocoa powder
- 1 pinch hot pepper flakes
- 1 dash ground cinnamon
- 1 pinch ground cardamom
- 1 tbsp sugar

## Directions

1. Heat up oat milk in a pot, then sieve the cocoa powder into it and mix with a whisk.

2. Add the remaining ingredients and let the hot chocolate warm up, stirring regularly.

3. When steam starts coming off the pot, monitor the temperature. You want to heat the chocolate up until it's at drinking temperature, but not much further.

4. Serve when hot.

## Notes

I usually dip my finger in quickly to check for the temperature. If you're quick enough it's basically impossible to burn yourself.
