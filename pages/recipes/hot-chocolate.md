# Hot Chocolate

## Ingredients

- 1 cup oat milk (Oatly barista works well)
- 3 tbsp cocoa powder
- 1 pinch hot pepper flakes
- 1 dash cinnamon
- 1 tbsp sugar

## Directions

1. Heat up oat milk in a sauce pan, then sieve the cocoa powder into it and mix with a whisk.

2. Add the remaining ingredients and let the hot chocolate warm up, stirring regularly.

3. As the temperature reaches 70 C, take off the heat and serve.

## Notes

- Milk shouldn't be heated too warm, but this means the beverage doesn't stay hot very long. If that annoys you, warm up the cup with boiling water before serving.
