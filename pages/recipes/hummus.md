# Hummus

## Ingredients

- 1 can chickpeas, or 100g dry chickpeas
- 4 tbsp tahini
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp cumin
- cold water

## Directions

1. If using dry chickpeas, soak them overnight, then cook them for 60--90 minutes.

2. In a blender or food processor, blend together the garlic, lemon juice, cumin, and salt. Afterwards, let everything sit for 10 minutes. The lemon will take the pungency off the garlic.

3. Add the tahini and let everything process for a few more minutes, until the tahini turns a bright white color. If necessary, add some cold water to loosen the mix.

4. Drain the chickpeas, reserving the liquid (aquafaba), then add them to the blender.

5. Blend everything for a long time, until light and smooth. Depending on the consistency, add some more cold water and/or aquafaba. The latter will help the hummus get very light and fluffy.

6. Adjust to taste with more tahini, lemon juice, or salt.
