# Hummus

## Ingredients

- 1 can or 240g cooked chickpeas, drained
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 60g tahini paste
- 40g olive oil
- 3/4 lemon, juiced
- 1/4 tsp salt
- water

## Directions

1. Blend all the ingredients together, adding more or less water to adjust the consistency.

## Notes

- Not the best hummus, I'm still looking for a simple recipe that gives better results.
- If you have dried chickpeas, 100g should give you about 240g cooked.
