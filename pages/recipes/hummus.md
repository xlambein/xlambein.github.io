# Hummus

## Ingredients

- 1 can chickpeas, or 100g dry chickpeas
- 4 tbsp tahini
- 1 clove garlic
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp cumin seeds or ground cumin

## Directions

1. If using dry chickpeas, soak them overnight, then cook them for 60--90 minutes. Drain the chickpeas, reserving the liquid (aquafaba).

2. In a blender or food processor, blend together the garlic, lemon juice, cumin, and salt. Afterwards, let everything sit for 5--10 minutes. The lemon will take the pungency off the garlic.

3. Add the tahini and let everything process for a few more minutes, until the tahini turns a bright white color. If necessary, add some aquafaba to loosen the mix.

4. Incorporate the chickpeas, plus some extra aquafaba, and blend everything together. Try putting just enough aquafaba for the blender to function properly, then let it run for a few minutes, until the hummus is light and smooth.

5. Depending on the taste and texture you want, adujst with more tahini, lemon juice, salt and/or aquafaba.
