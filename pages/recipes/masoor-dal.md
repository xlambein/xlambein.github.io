# Masoor Dal Tadka

## Ingredients

### Dal

- 1 cup red lentils
- 1/4 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 cups boiling water, more if needed

### Spice paste

- 1/2 tsp red chili powder
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/2 tsp ground coriander
- a splash of water

### Curry

- 2 tbsp oil
- 1 tsp cumin seeds
- 1 onion
- 3cm ginger, grated
- 2 cloves garlic, minced or grated
- 2 large tomatoes, cut in chunks
- 1 green chili, minced
- 1 tsp salt, or to taste

### Tadka

- 1 tbsp oil
- 1 dry red chili
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/4 tsp chili powder

## Directions

### Dal

1. Cook the lentils in water with the turmeric powder and salt, until they turn soft and mushy.

### Spice paste

2. Prepare the spice paste by mixing the ingredients in a bowl.

### Curry

3. In a pot, heat up the oil on medium heat, then add the cumin seeds to fry until they crackle and change color.

4. Add the onions, turning up the heat a little, and saut√© them until they start to brown.

5. Add the garlic and ginger, stirring regularly for a few seconds.

6. Pour the spice paste into the pot and stir constantly for a minute or so.

7. Add the tomatoes and let them cook for a while, until they've reduced a lot and turned soft.

8. Stir in the green chili.

9. Pour the cooked dal into the pot and mix well, then salt to taste.

10. Now's a good time to adjust the consistency by adding water if necessary. Note that dal tends to thicken up as it cools down.

### Tadka

11. Prepare the tadka by heating up some oil on medium heat in a small pot.

12. Add the garlic and dry chili to the oil, and let them fry for a couple of minutes, until the garlic is starting to brown.

13. Turn off the heat, add the chili powder, mix well, and pour over the dal.

14. Serve with rice and/or flat Indian bread.

## Notes

- Sub paprika for (some of) the red chili powder to reduce heat.
- This dish is easy to scale up, keeps well for a few days, and is freezer-friendly.
