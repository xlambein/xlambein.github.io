# Oatmeal

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup quick oats (Quaker are great)
- 1 cup almond milk, and a splash
- 1 heaping tsp brown sugar
- 1 tsp chia seeds

## Directions

1. Heat up the almond milk, sugar and chia seeds with a pinch of salt, until near boiling.

2. Add the quick oats and reduce to a simmer for a few minutes, until the consistency thickens. You want it to hold together, but still fall off a spoon.

3. Serve with your choice of toppings and an additional splash of almond milk.

## Notes

My choice of toppings include:

- Peanut butter
- Raspberry jam
- Pecan nuts
- Toasted coconut flakes
- Fresh strawberries
- Fresh blueberries

Often combining several of these.
