# Oven-Roasted Potatoes

## Ingredients

- 4--5 medium potatoes
- enough cooking oil

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 200 C.

2. Cut up the potatoes in cubes of 2--3 cm.

3. Boil the potatoes in salted water until barely fork-tender, slightly undercooked. Drain them and let the remaining water steam off in the pot.

4. Put the boiled potatoes on a baking tray and spray them generously with oil. Mix them up with your hands, you want to make sure they're well coated.

5. Bake in the oven For about 30 minutes, shuffling halfway through, until they're browned to your taste. The potatoes are already cooked, so stop the baking when you're happy with how they look and taste.

6. Dry the potatoes in paper towels, then season to taste with extra salt and spices of your choosing.
