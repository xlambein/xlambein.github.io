# Pancakes

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp butter
- 3/2 cup milk
- 1 tbsp sugar
- a splash vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp kala namak salt, sub normal salt
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp baking soda
- 1 tbsp corn starch
- 4/3 cup all purpose flour, adjust based on need

## Directions

1. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine the butter and milk, then microwave them for 1--2 minutes, until the milk is warm but not hot, and the butter can melt in it.

2. Add the remaining ingredients, except for the flour.

3. Incorporate the flour 1/3 or 2/3 cup at a time, until you reach a desired consistency. The batter should have a consistency near that of yogurt. Do not mix too much, to avoid developing the gluten.

4. Let the batter rest for at least 15 minutes.

5. Heat up a nonstick pan on medium heat for a few minutes.

6. When the pan is hot, melt a bit of butter in the center, then pour 1/3 cup of batter onto it.

7. After bubbles have formed on top of the pancake, flip it and let it cook for another minute or two.

8. Repeat until you run out of batter. No need to add more butter between each pancake.
