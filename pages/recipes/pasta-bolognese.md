# Pasta Bolognese

## Ingredients

- 360g pasta
- 100g small TVP
- 50ml soy sauce
- 1 tbsp powdered veggie stock
- provencal herbs
- 2 carrots, chopped roughly
- 2 onions, chopped roughly
- 150g celery, chopped roughly
- 3 cloves garlic, grated or finely chopped
- 1 can chunked tomatoes
- 400ml passata

## Directions

1. Cook the pasta according to package instructions.

2. In a bowl, combine the TVP, soy sauce, veggie stock and provencal herbs with a splash of hot water, enough to mostly cover everything. Mix thoroughly and let the TVP absorb the liquid.

3. In a blender, combine the carrots, onions and celery, then blend into small bits, but not into a paste.

4. Heat up some oil in a large saucepan, then add the blended mix, along with the garlic. Let the veggies brown a little, stirring regularly.

5. Drain the TVP, reserving the remaining liquid, and add them to the saucepan for a couple of minutes. Pour in the can of chunked tomatoes and the passata, along with some or all the remaining TVP liquid.

6. Let the sauce simmer for a few minutes, rectifying the seasoning if needed (e.g., by adding more of the TVP liquid).

7. Serve with the pasta.
