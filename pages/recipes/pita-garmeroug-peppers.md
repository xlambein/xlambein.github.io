# Pita with Garmeroug and Bell Peppers

## Ingredients

- 4 pita bread
- 3 red bell peppers, julienned
- 100g walnuts
- 20g breadcrumbs
- 60ml walnut oil
- 1/2 tsp hot pepper flakes
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tbsp lemon juice

## Directions

1. Stir-fry the bell peppers on high heat with a half tsp of salt for ~5 minutes. Reduce to medium heat, then cook until soft and golden.

2. Combine the walnuts, breadcrumbs, olive oil, hot pepper flakes, cumin and lemon juice, and blend everything together into a thick paste, the garmeroug.

3. Toast pita bread, cut them in halves and spread a generous amount of garmeroug inside, before filling them with the fried bell pepper.

## Notes

- If you don't have walnut oil, olive oil can work as well, though IMO it won't be as good.
