- 2/3 cup rice
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp sugar
- 2 tbsp rice vinegar
- 2/3 cucumber, cut into chunks
- 12 cherry tomatoes, quartered
- 2 carrots, grated
- 1 avocado, cut into squares

1. Rince the rice a few times, then soak it in water for at least half an hour. Add about 1 cup of water and cook until the water has evaporated. If the rice is still too raw, add more water.
  
2. While the rice is cooking, prepare the remaining ingredients.

3. Top the cooked rice with the vegetables and serve. Season with soy sauce and sesame seeds.
