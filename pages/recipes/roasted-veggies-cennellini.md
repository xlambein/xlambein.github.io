# Roasted winter veggies with cannellini sauce

## Ingredients

### Roasted veggies

- 1 large sweet potato, cubed
- 1 small broccoli or half a large, cut into florets
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 2 cups Brussels sprouts, halved
- 1 red onion, sliced
- 1 can chickpeas, drained
- olive oil

### Cannellini sauce

- 2 cans cannellini beans
- 1 clove garlic, minced or grated
- 1/2 cup veggie broth
- 1/2 lemon, juiced
- 1 tbsp nutritional yeast
- red pepper flakes, to taste
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp fresh herbs, chopped

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven at 200 C.

2. Cut the veggies and toss them in a large bowl with olive oil, salt and pepper. Lay them on a baking tray, and put them in the oven for about 30 minutes, until they're cooked through.

3. Combine all the sauce ingredients in a blender, putting only part of the veggie broth. Blend the mix together into a thick sauce, then heat it up in a saucepan. If it's too thick, dilute it with more broth.

4. Serve the roasted veggies topped with sauce and a side of your choice.

## Notes

- For the herbs, basil works well, but you can use whatever you have or strikes your fancy
- In terms of sides, you'll want something that'll soak up the sauce and pair with the veggies. I've tried couscous, but bread or greek pasta would be nice too.
