# Spinach & Cashew Pinwheels

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup raw cashews, soaked in water for 4-8 hours
- 1/4 cup milk
- 3/4 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 clove garlic
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 5 ounces frozen spinach, thawed
- 1/2 onion, chopped
- 1 tbsp fresh dill, chopped
- 1 sheet puff pastry

## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 200 C.

2. Drain spinach and squeeze it to remove moisture.

3. Blend spinach, cashews, milk, lemon juice, onion, garlic, dill and salt
   together until smooth.

4. Spread the mixture onto the puff pastry, then roll it into a sort of bastard
   sushi.

5. Cut the roll into 1 cm slices, placing each one onto a baking sheet.

6. Cook the pinwheels in the oven for about 25 minutes, until brown and puffy.
