# Split Peas and Leek Soup

## Ingredients

- 200g split peas
- 3 leeks, chopped
- 4 carrots, roughly chunked
- 1 1/2 tbsp veggie stock powder
- milk

## Directions

1. In a large pot, cover the peas with boiling water and let them simmer until cooked through, for about 30 minutes. To speed up cooking time, you can pre-soak the peas a few hours in advance.

2. Add the chopped veggies, alongside the veggie stock, and add hot water until nearly covered. Simmer for an additional 20 minutes, until the carrots are fork-tender.

3. Blend the soup, adding milk and/or water until the consistency is right. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

4. Serve with croutons and/or toasted bread and butter.
