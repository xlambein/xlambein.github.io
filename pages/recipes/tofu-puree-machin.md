# Tofu, Green Beans and Mashed Potatoes

## Ingredients

- 2 small tofu patties
- 1 onion, chopped finely
- 200g green beans, fresh or frozen
- 4 large potatoes
- butter
- milk
- nutmeg

## Directions

1. Heat up some oil and cook the onion with half a tsp of salt on medium heat. Your goal is to get reduced, caramelized onions. Stir regularly to avoid burning.

2. Meanwhile, peel, cut and boil the potatoes in salted water. Once cooked, add butter, milk, nutmeg, and mash until smooth.
  
3. Boil the green beans in salted water until soft and crunchy (follow package instructions). Add the caramelized onions.

4. Fry the tofu until golden brown. Serve with the vegetables.

## Notes

- This isn't much of a recipe, and more of a meal suggestion based on simple ingredients. The quality of this depends highly on how good the tofu patties are. I use "asian-style" marinated breaded tofu patties.
