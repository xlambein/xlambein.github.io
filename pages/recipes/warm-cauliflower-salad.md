# Warm Cauliflower Salad with Dates and Nuts

## Ingredients

- 1 cauliflower, chopped into medium chunks
- 1 bundle (6--7) spring onions
- 1 lemon, juiced
- 1/2 cup nuts, chopped (e.g., cashews, pistacchios)
- 8 dried dates, halved then sliced into small chunks
- olive oil
- bread, to serve

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 230C.

2. In a large mixing bowl, toss the chopped cauliflower with oil, salt and pepper to taste. Place on about 3/4 of a baking tray.

3. Mince the greens off half the spring onions and reserve.

4. Cut the remaining white and full spring onions into 2cm chunks, then place them on the last 1/4 of the baking tray. Lightly coat them in olive oil.

5. Bake for 10 minutes, until the spring onions have charred a little. Remove them, then shuffle the cauliflower across the tray.

6. Bake the cauliflower alone for another 10ish minutes, until the chunks have browned at the edges.

7. In a large bowl, combine the cooked and raw ingredients together. Add a drizzle of olive oil and mix well. Season to taste.

8. Serve with toasted bread.

## Notes

The source recipe uses pistachios. I found that you can't taste them too much, and since they tend to be expensive, you might wanna try with cashews or some other nuts.
