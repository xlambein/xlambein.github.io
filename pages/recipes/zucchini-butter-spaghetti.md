# Zucchini Butter Spaghetti

## Ingredients

- 80g butter
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 600g (~2) zucchini, grated
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1 tsp salt
- 200g spaghetti
- handful of fresh basil, cut into ribbons

## Directions

1. Melt the butter in a pan over medium-high heat, then add the garlic, stirring for a couple of minutes.

2. Add the zucchini, red pepper flakes and salt, then cook for 12-15 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the liquid has cooked off and the zucchini has softened. It shouldn't brown.

3. Meanwhile, cook the pasta in salted water until al dente. Drain, reserving about a cup of pasta water.

4. Pour in 1/2 cup of pasta water into the zucchini, stir it up, then incorporate the drained pasta and cook together for two more minutes. Use tongs or two forks to help mix the sauce with the pasta, adding more pasta water if necessary.

5. Serve with fresh basil.
