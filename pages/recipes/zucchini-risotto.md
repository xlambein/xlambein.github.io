# Zucchini Risotto

## Ingredients

- 2/3 cups risotto rice
- 2 cups water
- 1 veggie broth cube
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 tsp thyme
- 2 zucchinis, chunked
- 1 onion, minced
- 1 glass white wine

## Directions

1. In a bowl, rince the rice with the water until it turns white. Pour the water into a pot on high heat, along with the veggie broth, the bay leaf and the thyme. When the broth starts boiling, reduce the heat.

2. In a large pan, heat up some oil and cook the zucchini for about 15 minutes, stirring regularly.

3. In the meantime, pour some oil into a pan and fry the onions until transparent. Stir in the uncooked rice, fry for a minute, then pour the wine and wait for it to be absorbed.

4. Proceed to add the broth 1/2 cup at a time, letting the rice absorbe it before adding more. Once the rice is cooked, incorporate it into the zucchini.
