# Mini Sci-Zines

Inspired by [Malwine](http://malweene.com/) and [Éléonore Mayola](http://www.elle-est-au-nord.com/), I started a series of mini zines on exoplanets.  I had plans to make a few of those, but stopped after the second.  There's a third one sitting in a drawer, almost finished; I might come back to it someday.

Those zines are free to print & distribute.  Instructions on how to fold them (and also, how to make your own) [can be found here](http://www.rookiemag.com/2012/05/how-to-make-a-zine/).

## Sci-Zine #1: The Transit Method

## Sci-Zine #2: The Radial Velocity Method
