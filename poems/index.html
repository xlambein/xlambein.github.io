      <h2 id="hexes-for-peace">üòà Hexes for Peace&nbsp;<a href="#hexes-for-peace">#</a></h2>
      <p>Catch the Devil in a bottle<br>
      made of rocks and watch him toddle.<br>
      With the gems and incantation,<br>
      lord of flies here I shall summon!</p>
      <p>Let him fuel our every magick<br>
      with satanic mathematicks.<br>
      Golems made of sand, awaken!<br>
      Light our hearths, night be forsaken!<br>
      <br></p>
      <p>And doubtless he'll want to escape:<br>
      he'll try to melt his prison gate.<br>
      Cool him down and watch him bubble<br>
      in his bath of pest and trouble.<br></p>
      <p>Catch the Devil in a bottle,<br>
      let him warm up and then throttle.<br>
      Make sure you don't burn him fast or<br>
      no-one knows how long you'll last for.<br>
      <br></p>
      <p>If carelessly we set him free,<br>
      he'll burn our skin to third degree.<br>
      Dare to look him in the eyes and<br>
      you will beg for your demise.<br></p>
      <p>He'll poison water in our wells<br>
      and plague the air with ashy spells,<br>
      becurse you to a life of sorrow<br>
      (if you're not dead by tomorrow).<br>
      <br></p>
      <p>Catch the Devil in a bottle,<br>
      triple check your magick model.<br>
      If we ever set him free then<br>
      cursed me and cursed thee.</p>

      <p>My mouth is home to a handful of frogs.<br>
      We co-exist as symbiotic complements:<br>
      they're sheltered from the elements<br>
      and I get to have my mouth full of frogs.</p>

      <p>Soggy lips and toothy grin;<br>
      awake to blood and punctured skin.<br>
      You can't restrain the beast within<br>
      with soggy lips and toothy grin.</p>
      <p>A hairy chase in cool, white night.<br>
      Careful that it shan't die of fright,<br>
      for once they pass they don't taste right<br>
      after a hairy chase by night.</p>
      <p>Who dares disturb your peaceful rest<br>
      with crossed books and blessed quest?<br>
      By thousand devils you'll possess,<br>
      then may return to peaceful rest.</p>

      <p>I own too many bath ducks:<br>
      they cover the water, and when I'm in,<br>
      hide my body, as I tuck.</p>
      <p>I still can't bear to see my skin.</p>

      <h2 id="moss">ü•Ä moss&nbsp;<a href="#moss">#</a></h2>
      <p>sitting on my couch,<br>
      we were half drunk on sweet beer.<br>
      I spoke in this calloused voice<br>
      ploughing through words,<br>
      tryna find the ones that<br>
      will make love grow</p>
      <p>but I had it backwards:<br>
      love did not need growing.<br>
      the ground was fertile and<br>
      the seeds abundant<br>
      love sprouted‚Äîmoss on a grass lawn</p>
      <p>your words are like winter now.<br>
      it's August but the phone is freezing<br>
      and my voice, trembling</p>
      <p>once you told me you wished<br>
      some moments could be frozen in time<br>
      and lived through<br>
      forever</p>
      <p>I know what you meant now<br>
      but I also know<br>
      we don't have<br>
      the same<br>
      moments<br>
      in mind</p>

      <h2 id="hot">ü•µ Hot&nbsp;<a href="#hot">#</a></h2>
      <p>he<br>
      is<br>
      hot.</p>
      <p>not sexy hot, but burning hot<br>
      his body like a flesh oven<br>
      wishing (praying) for cold<br>
      but he will not cool down<br>
      he's a broken thermostat</p>
      <p>his moist apartment, moldy and littered<br>
      with bottles, now empty‚Äîfor<br>
      he left long ago<br>
      first for the basement, and<br>
      then for snow</p>
      <p>he could still eat but food<br>
      would burn on his tongue and<br>
      carbonize down his throat<br>
      his stomach was dry and<br>
      in lieu of digestion he would<br>
      breathe the ash in and<br>
      cough it out, a black cloud</p>
      <p>he will not die‚Äîof course he won't.<br>
      the fire burns too hot and<br>
      his heart, that steam engine,<br>
      will. not. stop.<br>
      pumping lava down his arteries<br>
      with each beat, pulsing and scorching<br>
      up his arms<br>
      down his legs and<br>
      all the way to the tip of his head</p>
      <p>when snow no longer sufficed<br>
      when it sublimed against<br>
      his naked body in<br>
      the dead of winter,<br>
      he headed north<br>
      for colder weather<br>
      then for colder water</p>
      <p>finally,<br>
      teathered to a rock‚Äî<br>
      its smooth surface melting<br>
      to magma against his skin‚Äî<br>
      he threw himself off land<br>
      and into the arctic depths</p>
      <p>there he remains, a hotspot volcano,<br>
      fizzing water into vapour<br>
      killing fish and changing the weather</p>
      <p>there's no longer ice in the north pole<br>
      and soon no more water either<br>
      the air is misty like Venus'<br>
      and everything is dying</p>
      <p>and at last<br>
      at very last</p>
      <p>he<br>
      is<br>
      tepid.</p>

      <p>graceful egg<br>
      beautiful egg<br>
      painted white and blue<br>
      bejeweled by dew</p>
      <p>I<br>
      caress your shell and cry,<br>
      knowing one day you'll die<br>
      when that something most wretched<br>
      from your entrails hatched</p>
      <p>graceful egg<br>
      beautiful egg<br>
      I now must face the truth<br>
      for soon cometh the<br>
