    <p>A small web replica of the party game <a href="https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com">Cards Against Humanity</a>.  It’s mainly a learning project, to try and build a full-stack web app in Rust.  The backend is based on <a href="https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp">warp</a>, and the front-end is made with <a href="https://yew.rs">Yew</a>.  The two communicate via web sockets.</p>

<p>It’s been a fun project to make, but my general conclusion is that Yew is not a good framework for making games—it’s really designed for web apps.  Baking web socket support back into it was a hassle, and I haven’t figured out nice ways to handle game scenes or to render animations.</p>
<p>I haven’t tested it online, but it works well on my local network.  The game is extremely rough on the edges, but all the essential features are here: you can join a game, select cards, play them, vote for an answer, and the score is tracked.  What’s missing is stuff like end-game, keeping sessions between reload, instant messaging, and a good deal of design polish.</p>
<p>One of my favourite aspects of making a card game in Rust is that you can leverage the borrow checker to ensure that a card is never duplicated.  The deck owns all its cards, and when a player draws one, ownership is transferred to the player’s hand.  After being played, a card is transferred to the discard pile.  With true linear types, we could further ensure that cards are never deleted, but afaik there’s no way to support this at compile-time.</p>
<p>Another fun part of this project was writing the cards.  Many of them were taken directly from the original board game, but <a href="https://mandooks.com">Mandooks</a> and I spent part of an evening coming up with original ones, mostly based on our friend group’s inside jokes and references.  This made testing the game extremely funny.</p>
<p>As always, <a href="https://github.com/xlambein/rust-against-humanity">source code is available on GitHub</a>.</p>
