    <p>Right after my graduation (literally, the day after) I went to Berlin
    for the entire month of July to participate in a program at the <a href=
    "http://schoolofma.org/">School of Machines, Making and Make-believe</a>.
    The “School of Ma” is an independent school at the intersection of art and
    technology, run by Rachel Uwa. Every month, a course is organized around a
    specific theme, and multiple instructors are invited to come and teach to a
    dozen or so students.</p>
    <p>The course I took part in was called <a href=
    "http://schoolofma.org/winners-and-losers.html">“Winners and Losers”</a>,
    subtitled “Interactive electronics, play & experimental games”. It started
    with a two-weeks primer on electronics and the use of microcontrollers,
    followed by one week on motors and mechatronics in general, and finished
    with a project in small groups, spanning the fourth week. <a href=
    "http://alicestew.art/">Alice Stewart</a> was the teacher for the first two
    weeks, while <a href="http://katihyyppa.com/">Kati Hyyppä</a> and <a href=
    "https://www.niklasroy.com/">Niklas Roy</a> taught the third week and
    supervised the projects.</p>
    <h1 id="the-machine">“The Machine”</h1>
    <p>Our project—called “The Machine”—is a kind of slot machine generating
    random sentences. The “players” are invited to insert a (fake) coin, select
    the kind of interaction they desire—“poetry”, “question” or “challenge”—and
    then watch the reels turn and stop on three phrases which, when combined,
    form a sentence. The project is a collaboration between myself, <a href=
    "https://vimeo.com/annabrynskov">Anna Brynskov</a>, and <a href=
    "https://www.elementlichtdesign.com/">Maryam Aghajani</a>. Anna is a
    student in digital design and a filmmaker from Aarhus, Denmark; Maryam is
    an architectural lighting designer from Canada, working in Berlin.</p>

        The front of the Machine. You can see the coin slot in the top-left
        corner, the three buttons below corresponding to the three kinds of
        sentences, and the front display with the reels. Through the holes
        punched in its body shines an airy, changing light. Off to the right is
        a glass full of the fake "SoMA coins" (more on that below). Additional
        cute detail: The LED eyes, which flash after the final reel stops.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>To better demonstrate how it works, here’s a short video of me using the
    Machine. After I insert a coin and I press the “poetry” button, the reels
    immediately start turning. Eventually, they stop on three random phrases of
    the “poetry” type (written in black), and the LED eyes blink.</p>

    <h1 id="making-of">Making Of</h1>
    <p>Because we had complementary skills, we tended to gravitate towards what
    we each did best. Being the computer scientist of the group, I took care of
    most of the programming. I also built the motorized reels and designed the
    electronics that control them.</p>
    <p>Maryam, as a skilled designer, created the entire body of the Machine,
    from the wooden frame to the finishing paint—and of course, the lighting.
    She did an amazing job, giving the finished product a distinctive
    aesthetic.</p>
    <p>Anna was fairly versatile in this project: She designed parts of the
    electronics along with the Arduino code that came with it; she helped
    Maryam with the aesthetics; and finally, thanks to her literary background,
    she wrote the poetry that make up the core of the interactions with the
    Machine.</p>
    <p>The obvious downside of this approach is that none of us actually worked
    on every aspect of the project. For example, I did nothing to help with the
    design and the woodwork, while Maryam didn’t do any of the electronics and
    programming. In retrospect, I think it would have been more fun for
    everyone to have a more equitable distribution of tasks. However, I would
    also say that the time constraints and the pressure made this difficult to
    achieve.</p>
    <p>The week of development and crafting culminated in a small event
    organized at the <a href="http://www.liebig12.net/">Liebig12</a> space in
    Berlin, where each team showcased their project. Dozens of visitors came by
    throughout the evening of July 27 to play the various experimental games
    presented there. The feedback was very positive, and it was a lot of fun to
    see so many people interact with the installation.</p>

    <p>I will now delve into the more technical aspects of the project. As an
    overview, here’s a list of the various components that make up the
    Machine:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A painted wooden box, housing all the components, with a removable
      wooden frame holding the reels and the Arduino microcontrollers</li>
      <li>A coin slot (1), attached to the wooden box, made with an LED and a
      light detector</li>
      <li>Three buttons for sentence type selection (2)</li>
      <li>Two Arduino Uno, one serving as a motor driver (3), and the other (4)
      handling the user interface and the random sentence generation</li>
      <li>Three cardboard reels (5) with phrases on them, each powered by a
      stepper motor</li>
      <li>A set of four Neo-Pixels, acting as “eyes” for the Machine</li>
      <li>A light with changing hue, attached in the box, creating ambient
      lighting</li>
      <li>An LED strip, attached to the inside near the reels, lighting up the
      current sentence</li>
      <li>An additional set of Neo-Pixels around the coin slot, lit up by a
      third Arduino Uno</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Like I said, I was only involved in the reels, the electronics and the
    programming. Hence, I will restrict my technical account of the project to
    these aspects.</p>
    <h2 id="the-reels">The Reels</h2>
    <figure>
      <img src="the-machine-004.jpg">
      <figcaption>
        A single reel, removed from its support.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Let’s start with the reels. The structure of each reel is made of a long
    piece of bent cardboard attached to a disk. Glued to its axis is a stepper
    motor (6), which is a DC motor that moves in discrete steps—in our case, 96
    steps of 3.75°. Thanks to this, we gain the ability to control exactly by
    how much a reel rotates. Then, given a reference point, we can ask the
    motor to rotate such that any specific phrase is facing the user: If we
    know the motor is currently 20 steps from the reference point, and we want
    to show a phrase that is 55 steps from the reference, we just order the
    motor to rotate by 25 steps.</p>
    <p>Therefore, the critical part is to reliably determine a reference point.
    Indeed, when the Machine is turned on, each reel can be in any position,
    and we have no way of knowing which. To solve this problem, we used a
    combination of a small magnet (7) and a Reed switch (8), which is a switch
    that closes when inside of a magnetic field. When the Machine is booted,
    each reel starts rotating, stopping when the Reed switch is facing the
    magnet. Once this happened, we know for sure the exact position of the
    reel, and we can use it as a reference point.</p>
    <p>Finally, a slit (9) on the axis provides an easy way of attaching and
    removing the reel from a screwhead (10) on the support:</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="the-machine-005.jpg">

    </figure>
    <h2 id="the-motor-driver-arduino">The Motor Driver Arduino</h2>
    <p>Because we needed more pins than can fit on a single Arduino Uno, we
    split the tasks between two Arduinos that communicate over two pins through
    I2C. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C">I2C</a> is a common
    protocol for communication between integrated circuits, and it’s available
    by default in the <a href=
    "https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/Wire">Arduino “Wire” library</a>. In
    I2C, one Arduino is said to be the “master”, while the other is the
    “slave”. The master can either send a message to the slave, or it can ask
    the slave for a message. The slave, in return, can receive messages, and
    respond to a request from the master. In this context, a message is simply
    a string of characters or bytes.</p>
    <p>The slave Arduino (3) was designed to be a simple motor driver for
    controlling the three reels. It constantly listens for a command to be sent
    as an I2C message. When that happens, if the reel specified in the command
    is not busy, it executes the task; otherwise, the command is ignored.
    Additionally, it can be asked by the I2C master to give the state of each
    motor: Idle or busy.</p>
    <p>Among the possible commands, the main ones are “Calibrate”, which tells
    a reel to seek the magnet with the Reed switch, and “RotateSeek”, which
    tells a reel to rotate a specific number of turns, and then seek a
    specified position corresponding to some phrase. Directly seeking a phrase
    without rotating a few turns would work as well, but it’s <em>way</em> less
    exciting to watch. If you look at the code, you’ll find other commands
    (e.g. “Rotate”, “Seek”, “Next”, “Previous”) that were introduced for
    debugging purposes.</p>
    <p>Formally, commands are expressed as simple 4-bytes I2C messages:</p>
    <pre><code>[command code][motor ID][parameter 1][parameter 2]</code></pre>
    <p>The first two bytes, “command code” and “motor ID”, respectively
    identify a command and a reel. Depending on the command, the next couple of
    bytes can specify the number of turns and/or the specific phrase to
    seek.</p>
    <p>As an example, here is the command to tell motor 1 to rotate 3 turns and
    stop on position 43:</p>
    <pre><code>6 1 3 43</code></pre>
    <p>where <code>6</code> is the command code that identifies the
    “RotateSeek” command.</p>
    <p>Two transistor arrays were necessary to provide power to the stepper
    motors, so we decided to put them on a custom Arduino shield for the motor
    driver. The process took a great part of the day, but I was quite proud of
    the result. It contains a DC power input (11), the two transistor arrays
    (12), and many additional pins in which to plug the motors (13) and I2C
    wires (14):</p>
    <figure>

    </figure>
    <h2 id="the-controller-arduino">The Controller Arduino</h2>
    <p>The entire logic of the Machine is contained within the master Arduino
    (4), which we called the “controller”. It manages the coin slot, the
    buttons, the “eyes”, and the commands sent to the motor driver. Its
    behaviour is fairly simple: At first, it waits for a coin to be inserted
    into the the coin slot. When that happens, it waits for a button to be
    pressed. Depending on the button, it then selects one phrase at random for
    each reel, and sends three “RotateSeek” commands (one for each motor) to
    the driver Arduino. Then, it waits, asking the slave regularly whether the
    reels have stopped turning. When the motor driver replies that they have,
    the controller flashes the LED eyes, and becomes ready again for another
    coin and button press.</p>
    <h2 id="the-coin-slot">The Coin Slot</h2>
    <p>I’ll finish with a small comment on the coin slot (1), which Anna made.
    It is a cardboard tube (15) attached to the front of the machine,
    containing a light sensor (16) facing an LED (17). When a coin is dropped
    through the tube, it momentarily blocks the light from the LED as it falls,
    triggering the light sensor.</p>

    <p>Rather than have people use real money, we provided our original “SoMA”
    coins, the unofficial School of MA cardboard currency (our <abbr title=
    "Initial Cardboard Offering">ICO</abbr> will start soon). Fun anecdote:
    During the evening, we discovered that the coin slot was sensitive enough
    to be triggered by a mini pretzel. Thankfully this had no effect on the
    exchange rate of SoMA coins.</p>
    <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
    <p>While stressful and/or difficult at times, I really enjoyed this
    project. Being a software person, it had been a while since I’d done
    anything as hands-on as this; after two years of Master in CS, the
    experience was positively refreshing. In addition, the final evening was
    amazing: Observing people interact with the installation and receiving
    feedback from them was incredibly rewarding.</p>
    <p>I’d like to give a special thanks and shout-out to my teammates, Anna
    and Maryam. Getting to work with the two of you was among the best parts of
    this experience. I’m glad we stuck together through some of the harder
    stuff, and I feel so proud of what we managed to accomplish together.</p>
